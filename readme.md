TODO:
  -When mapping the vinyls map the first value only, then use the buttons to increment the i value to map new vinyls as the buttons are pressed?
    -Make sure the left button is disabled when the value is 0/1 (whatever the lowest value is in the context)
    -Test this to ensure it isn't too slow of a load time, look into to preemptively loading the images in the background?
  -Research the url parameter structure for my common vinyl sites and auto populate it so that a manual is not required.
  -Look into potential ways of grabbing images from google that meet search criteria?
    -Really cool idea would be using api's that grab the album images and pasting them onto a template vinyl image
  -Find out where youtube and spotify pull lyric data and see if tracklist data can be pulled as well.
    -Add autofill buttons to each field that run the api's and allow manual revision of the results as well as manual entry.
  -Ensure a lightbox-esc functionality is in place for the vinyl images.
    -To get real crazy, could add a 3D functionality that would allow you to rotate the vinyl when viewing.
  -Add state modifiers for each vinyl: wishlisted, purchased, and removed.  Add removal functionality by storing the removed info for the session and allow removed vinyls to be re-added.  Once the site has been closed the data is gone.

DONE:
  -Build the whole site/app as a pivot table so that you can toggle between the list and adding section.  Otherwise try adding a dialog or seperate section for adding new items to the list from the app.
  -store the vinyl info in JSON or CSV.  JSON would be easier for the initial manual entry.
